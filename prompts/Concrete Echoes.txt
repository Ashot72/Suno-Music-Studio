Title: Concrete Echoes

Prompt:

[Intro: Slow, distorted sub-bass pulse, distant industrial reverb, low vinyl crackle]
[Spoken: Cold, restrained voice, slightly filtered]
No sirens tonight…
Just the echo of the city breathing.

[Verse 1: Low, breathy spoken-rhythmic delivery, controlled and detached]
Footsteps fading in the tunnels below
Neon’s gone, but the signal still glows
Concrete walls hold memories tight
Every word etched in static and light
I don’t rush, I don’t chase the sound
I move slow where the echoes are found

[Chorus: Minimal, hypnotic, emotionally restrained]
These streets remember my name
Even when the data’s erased
I don’t scream, I don’t break
I remain

[Verse 2: Slightly more intensity, subtle distortion grows]
Old codes humming in abandoned lines
Truth buried deep in corrupted signs
They built the cage, they sold the lie
But I watch the system rust in real time

[Instrumental Break: Sparse analog pad, low industrial hits, filtered noise]

[Bridge: Whispered, intimate]
They thought silence was control…
But silence is where I survive.

[Final Chorus: Wider, heavier low-end, same calm delivery]
These streets remember my name
Even when the data’s erased
I don’t scream, I don’t break
I remain

[Outro: Fading tape hiss, low synth drone]
Still connected…
Still here…

[End]
